# Who
I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in collective behaviour and complex systems. I like studying human populations, contacts and social networks, often guided by the study of large, relevant datasets. Infectious disease epidemiology and the subtle interplay between human behaviour and disease transmission remains an open problem that I spend a lot of time thinking about.
